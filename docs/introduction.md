# NeuroAnalyst: What is it for?
## Objectives
NeuroAnalyst is an effort to - 
1. Make neuroimaging analysis more reproducible by streamlining compute environments, enforcing dataset standards, generating standardized multi-parametric multi-dataset image analysis results and provenance.
2. Enhance intepretability of scientific analysis by contextualizing image analysis results with relevant scientific literature.

## Significance
Neuroimaging research plays a crucial role in advancing our understanding of brain structure, function, and disorders, contributing significantly to neuroscience and clinical practice. The field has experienced exponential growth in recent years, generating vast amounts of complex data that require sophisticated analysis techniques. Despite advancements in data analysis platforms, significant challenges persist in improving reproducibility, interpretability, interoperability, and provenance across the neuroimaging landscape.

## General Architecture
There are two fundamental components of NeuroAnalyst-
1. Core API - The backbone of the platform, the Core API allows users to Create, Read, Update and Delete (CRUD) data pipelines and their individual process units.
2. Insight API - Utilizing user queries or prompts as triggers, the aim of the Insight API is to contextualize the results of data pipelines with relevant scientific literature, generating comprehensive, context-aware answers.

## Using NeuroAnalyst
NeuroAnalyst can be accessed via a Graphical User Interface (GUI), as well as a Text User Interface (TUI). Follow the instructions below to run this platform locally-
