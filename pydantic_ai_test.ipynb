       "AgentRunResult(data=\"As a doctor at MD Anderson Cancer Center, I'd be happy to explain what cancer is.\\n\\nCancer is a term used to describe a group of diseases characterized by the uncontrolled growth and spread of abnormal cells. Normally, cells in our body grow, divide, and die in a controlled manner. However, in cancer, this process goes awry, and cells begin to grow and divide uncontrollably, forming tumors.\\n\\nThese abnormal cells can invade and damage surrounding tissues and organs, and in some cases, they can break away from the primary tumor and travel to other parts of the body through the bloodstream or lymphatic system, a process known as metastasis.\\n\\nCancer can arise from any type of cell in the body, and there are over 100 different types of cancer, each with its unique characteristics and behaviors. Some common types of cancer include carcinomas (e.g., breast, lung, colon), sarcomas (e.g., bone, soft tissue), leukemias (blood cancers), and lymphomas (cancers of the immune system).\\n\\nIn the case of the patient I'm about to diagnose, we're dealing with a rare form of cancer, which makes it even more challenging to identify and treat. But with the help of advanced diagnostic tools and a multidisciplinary team of experts, we're well-equipped to tackle this complex case.\")"
